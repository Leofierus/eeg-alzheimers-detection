# CNN-based NDD Classification from EEG Signals

This repository contains the code for classifying neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) from EEG signals using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The code is written in Python and uses the PyTorch library. The dataset used in this project is the [A dataset of EEG recordings from: Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal dementia and Healthy subjects](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004504/versions/1.0.7) from OpenNeuro.

## Requirements
